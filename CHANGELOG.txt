## [2.0.0] - June 14, 2021
  * removed dependency on Python:
    - clustering of visual features done using vlfeat's kdtree implementation (added dependency on vlfeat)
  * Simplified user interface which is now based solely on HTML/CSS/Javascript
    - frontend is based solely on HTML/CSS/Javascript (previously, VISE used a python cherrypy based server for generating frontend)
    - many work load transferred from backend server to user's web browser
    - VISE server only generates basic HTML pages containing dynamic data stored as Javascript variable
    - web browser renders the page based on dynamic data contained in Javascript variable
    - VISE servers sends homography matrix and web browser uses Javascript and HTML canvas to generate registered images and required visualisations
  * upgraded code to support compilation in Linux (gcc), Windows (Visual C++) and MacOS (Clang)
  * setup CI/CD pipeline (build and test stages) for Windows 10
    - automatically builds using Visual C++ compiler on Windows 10 platform
    - integration test based on Oxford Buildings 100 images subset and its ground truth derived from the full Oxford Buildings 5k dataset
    - uses NSIS to package Windows 10 64 bit installer
  * images get resized based on user defined max. size (defined in project configuration file)
  * indexing process log saved to a file for reporting
  * a basic GUI application to launch VISE server in Windows 10
  * faster indexing of projects using generic visual vocabulary
    - VISE ships with a generic visual vocabulary computed using 53629 images
    - this speeds up the process of indexing (at the loss of some search accuracy) of new projects
  * rewrote VISE http server
    - all functionality of VISE software is now exposed using a REST HTTP API
    - multiple worker threads handle HTTP requests
  * following software features that have been implemented but not yet fully tested have been queued for future release:
    - visual grouping of images
    - metadata import and search

## [2.0.0-internal-releases] - 2018, 2019, 2020
  * VISE code was adapted and extended to address the requirements of several internal and collaborative projects at VGG between 2018 and 2020.

## [1.0.3] - September 28, 2017
  * international characters (utf-8) are now allowed in image filenames (issue 15)
  * uppercase image filename extensions (PNG, JPG) are now allowed (issue 17)

## [1.0.2] - September 07, 2017
  * docker container for Linux, MacOS and Windows

## [1.0.1] - July 05, 2017
  * fixed issues with load, start, stop and uninstall scripts
  * debugging log saved to $HOME/vgg/vise/log/training.log
  * user images are resized *only* if > 1024px
  * added Refresh button to indexing page to deal with unresponsive pages (temporary fix)

## [1.0.0] - June 15, 2017
  * a web based user interface to index new images

## [0.0.2] - March 16, 2017
  * updated source code and cmake files to allow compilation in Mac OS
  * mostly used by @Giles Bergel (Seebibyte project ambassador) to demonstrate potential users

## [0.0.1] - September 25, 2014
  * the original relja_retrival codebase was released internally within the Visual Geometry Group (VGG)
  * developed by Relja Arandjelovic during his DPhil / Postdoc at the Visual Geometry Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford.
